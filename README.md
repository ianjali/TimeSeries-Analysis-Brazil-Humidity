# Timeseries Brazil
Run the main.py for this project.
LSTM might give nan sometime but will run on multiple attempt. 


For Dataset, due to size limitation I could not upload it. But to run the project I would recommend downloading the dataset from Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region

Download the dataset for north region 
Either save it in Dataset/Archive folder or 
Change the path to read the dataset to wherever you are saving north.csv
